# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Ryan Enshaie

Zinsser claims people try to sound important versus simply saying what needs to be said. Every sentence must be stripped to its cleanest components. Readers have short
attention spans so clutter makes them lose track or misinterpret ideas. Zinsser says thinking clearly is a concious act that writers must force upon themselves to 
write clearly. Clutter is used by professionals or corporations to hide their mistakes and soften the blow of the truth. It acts as camoflauge which hides the truth 
behind confusing sentences. To improve writing, Zinsser says simple and shorter is better and every word must do work.
